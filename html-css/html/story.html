        <section>
            <h2 style="text-align: center;">1. The Story</h2>
            <p><em>Maus: A Survivor’s Tale</em> is the illustrated true story of Vladek Spiegelman’s experiences during World War II, as told by his son, Artie.<br> It consists of Book One: My Father Bleeds History, and Book Two: And Here My Troubles Began
                / From Mauschwitz to the Catskills and Beyond.</p>

            <p>While the story is primarily focused on Vladek’s life, there is also a frame narrative (or, a story within the story) that shows Artie and his father interacting in the present, with Artie asking questions as Vladek relays his experiences.
                As Vladek describes the horrors that he faced as a Jewish person in World War II, there are interspersed scenes that reveal some of the challenges that Artie faces as the son of a concentration camp survivor. For example, Vladek is obsessive
                about money and constantly fusses over Artie’s clothes, decisions, and refusal to eat everything on his plate (even though Artie is an adult).</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2 style="margin-top:35px; text-align: center">2. Full Synopsis</h2>
            <p> Most of the book weaves in and out of two timelines. In the frame tale of the narrative present, Spiegelman interviews his father, Vladek, in Rego Park, New York, in 1978–79. The story that Vladek tells is depicted in the narrative past, which
                begins in the mid-1930s and continues until the end of the Holocaust in 1945.</p>

            <p>In Rego Park in 1958, a young Art Spiegelman complains to his father that his friends have left him behind. His father responds in broken English, "Friends? Your friends? If you lock them together in a room with no food for a week, then you
                could see what it is, friends!"</p>

            <p>As an adult, Art visits his father, from whom he has become estranged. Vladek has married a woman called Mala in the time since the 1968 suicide of Art's mother, Anja. Art wants Vladek to recount his Holocaust experience. Vladek tells of his
                time in Częstochowa, describing how he came to marry into Anja's wealthy family in 1937 and move to Sosnowiec to become a manufacturer. Vladek begs Art not to include this part of the story in the book, and Art reluctantly agrees. Anja
                suffers a breakdown due to postpartum depression after giving birth to their first son, Richieu and the couple go to a sanitarium in Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia for her to recover. After they return, political and antisemitic tensions
                build until Vladek is drafted just before the Nazi invasion. Vladek is captured at the front and forced to work as a prisoner of war. After he is released, he finds Sosnowiec has been annexed by Germany, and he is dropped off on the other
                side of the border in the Polish protectorate. He sneaks across the border and reunites with his family.</p>

            <p>During one of Art's visits, he finds that a friend of Mala's has sent the couple one of the underground comix magazines Art had contributed to. Mala had tried to hide it, but Vladek finds and reads it. In "Prisoner on the Hell Planet", Art
                is traumatized by his mother's suicide three months after his release from the mental hospital, and in the end depicts himself behind bars, saying "You murdered me, Mommy, and left me here to take the rap!"[3] Though it brings back painful
                memories, Vladek admits that dealing with the issue in such a way was for the best.</p>

            <p>In 1943, Sosnowiec Ghetto's Jews are moved to Srodula, then marched to Sosnowiec to work. The family splits up—Vladek and Anja send Richieu to Zawiercie to be with his aunt, where they believe he will be safe. As the roundups increase, and
                more Jews are sent from the ghettos to Auschwitz, the aunt poisons herself, her children, and Richieu to escape the Gestapo. In Srodula, many Jews, including Vladek, build bunkers to hide from the Germans. Vladek's bunker is discovered
                and he is placed into a "ghetto inside the ghetto", surrounded by barbed wire. The remnants of Vladek and Anja's family are taken away. Srodula is cleared of its Jews, except for a group Vladek hides with in another bunker. When the Germans
                depart, the group splits up and leaves the ghetto.</p>

            <p>In Sosnowiec, Vladek and Anja move from one hiding place to the next, making occasional contact with other Jews in hiding. Vladek disguises himself as an ethnic Pole and hunts for provisions. They arrange with smugglers to escape to Hungary,
                but it is a trick—the Gestapo arrest them on the train and take them to Auschwitz, where they are separated until after the war.</p>

            <p>Art asks after Anja's diaries, which Vladek tells him were her account of her Holocaust experiences. They are the only way to find out what happened to her after her separation from Vladek at Auschwitz. Vladek tells Art she had said, "I wish
                my son, when he grows up, he will be interested in this." Vladek comes to admit that he burned them after she killed herself. Art is enraged, and calls Vladek a "murderer".</p>

            <p>The story jumps to 1986, after the first six chapters of Maus had been collected into a single volume. Art is overcome with the unexpected attention the book receives, finding himself "totally blocked". Art talks with his psychiatrist, Paul
                Pavel, a Czech Holocaust survivor, about the book. Pavel suggests that, as those who perished in the camps can never tell their stories, "maybe it's better not to have any more stories". Art replies with a quote from Samuel Beckett: "Every
                word is like an unnecessary stain on silence and nothingness", but then realizes, "on the other hand, he said it".</p>

            <p>Vladek tells of his hardship in the camps, of starvation and abuse, of his resourcefulness, of avoiding the selektionen—the selection process by which prisoners were selected for further labor or execution. Though it is dangerous, Anja and
                Vladek can occasionally exchange messages. As the war progresses and the German front is pushed back, the prisoners are marched from Auschwitz in Poland to Gross-Rosen within the Reich, and then to Dachau, where the hardships only increase
                and Vladek catches typhus.</p>

            <p>The war ends, the camp survivors are freed, and Vladek and Anja reunite. The book closes with Vladek turning over in his bed and telling Art, "I'm tired from talking, Richieu, and it's enough stories for now." The final image is of Vladek
                and Anja's tombstone—Vladek died in 1982, before the book was completed.</p>

            <div>
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspArt Spiegelman born Itzhak Avraham ben Zeev Spiegelman on February 15, 1948) is an American cartoonist, editor, and comics advocate best known for his graphic novel Maus.<br> His work as co-editor on the comics magazines
                    Arcade and Raw has been influential, and from 1992 he spent a decade as contributing artist for The New Yorker. <br>He is married to designer and editor Françoise Mouly, and is the father of writer Nadja Spiegelman.
                </p>

                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSpiegelman began his career with Topps (a bubblegum and trading card company) in the mid-1960s, which was his main financial support for two decades; there he co-created parodic series such as Wacky Packages in the
                    1960s and Garbage Pail Kids in the 1980s. He gained prominence in the underground comix scene in the 1970s with short, experimental, and often autobiographical work. A selection of these strips appeared in the collection Breakdowns
                    in 1977, after which Spiegelman turned focus to the book-length Maus, about his relationship with his father, a Holocaust survivor. The postmodern book depicts Germans as cats, Jews as mice, and ethnic Poles as pigs, and took 13 years
                    to create until its completion in 1991. It won a special Pulitzer Prize in 1992 and has gained a reputation as a pivotal work.</p>

                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSpiegelman and Mouly edited eleven issues of Raw from 1980 to 1991. The oversized comics and graphics magazine helped introduce talents who became prominent in alternative comics, such as Charles Burns, Chris Ware,
                    and Ben Katchor, and introduced several foreign cartoonists to the English-speaking comics world. Beginning in the 1990s, the couple worked for The New Yorker, which Spiegelman left to work on In the Shadow of No Towers (2004), about
                    his reaction to the September 11 attacks in New York in 2001.</p>

                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSpiegelman advocates for greater comics literacy. As an editor, a teacher at the School of Visual Arts in New York City, and a lecturer, Spiegelman has promoted better understanding of comics and has mentored younger
                    cartoonists.
