        <h3><em>Inside a war, information is more important <strong>than ever</strong>. More important than firepower and as important as loyalty. This phrase has awalys been true, but in the contemporany world, the tecnology and the policy has changed the way we think about information.</em></h3>

    <div class="texto1">
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe current world is interconnected by a large network. Even though the internet is now accessible to people with a certain financial condition, the origin of this network is military in nature.</p>
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn the late 1960s, the United States was developing a way to connect computers to share information during the Cold War. From this research, the ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) was created. In the future, this network split in two. The ARPANET became available for the population, and the MILNET (Militar Network) was created and destined to NSA (National Security Agency) and USDOD (United States Department of Defense) that are linked to the CIA and the FBI. These organizations continually spy the American people.</p>
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFor example, Edward Snowden, ex-administrator of the CIA's systems revealed to the world how the CIA spies the population. A documentary that shows this story well is called <em>"Citizenfour"</em> that can be watched <a href="https://youtu.be/kPCd0rMYxjg" target="_blank">here</a>. The movie <em>"Snowden"</em> that can be wacthed <a href="https://youtu.be/2mxA8zggX7I" target="_blank">here</a> is very good too. Today, Snowden lives at Russia, exiled, and is prohibited from entering American territory.</p>
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWhat is the relationship between these facts and the hq? Well, Maus happens during the World War II and the post-war period. A very important factor to the end of the war was Alan Turing and the <em>Enigma</em>, a machine that nazists used to transmit information.</p>
        <p>The importance of the information is developed in story in the relationship between Anja and her communist friend. He sent her important documents that she was supposed to hide. But Anja decided to involve the seamstress, giving her the documents. In the future, the seamstress was arrested. See a part of the scene below: </p>

        <hr>
        <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<em>"Information trafficking"</em> is still present today. Mainly in politics where indirect manipulation of the people is essential. But it's not just the information that matters. The "way" in which it is transmitted is also important. That "way" is called Narrative. And a narrative needn't be true. Just convince. That's why the spread of fake news is so common. The tension that is currently experienced is caused by the enormous amount of information. The tecnology is a double-edged sword.</p>
