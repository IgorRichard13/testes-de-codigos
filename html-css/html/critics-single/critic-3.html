            <p>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp During one of the chapters, we see Vladek being recruited as a soldier to
                serve his country against the growing Nazi threat. Initially, Vladek did not shoot, either because he
                had no experience in that type of military combat,
                or because of his own choice. But that changes when his commander forces him to fight.
                <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Vladek observes through the scope of his weapon, a 'tree' moving, and
                instinctively recognizes, it was an enemy. In a war, you will never stop to think "What is my enemy
                feeling? What does he want? Should
                we really be fighting each other?", he is a person who is fighting for the other side, and for honor and
                defense. of your country, you must kill him.
                <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp After shooting a few times, the man disguised as a tree falls and raises
                his hand, symbolizing a kind of surrender, but this doesn't stop Vladek, who shoots several times in a
                row, until that person dies.
                Looking from Vladek's perspective alone, this was the best thing to do, that person was an enemy, an
                enemy is a threat, and a threat must be eliminated.
                <br> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp But... For that man who had just lost his life, he was also fighting for
                his country, maybe out of obligation, maybe out of patriotism, but one doubt remains: "Was he wrong?",
                both Vladek and his enemy had
                a life own, a family, friends, a job, a history... During wars, human lives are just statistics. During
                World War II, it is estimated that between 70 and 85 million people died, a relatively small number for
                an event of a catastrophic
                global scale, given that the world population was about 2.3 billion people in 1940. . <br>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp However, each of these people had a life story, they had a family to take care
                of, they had a whole life to write, and
                because of the choice of a few people in the world, they had all that abruptly stopped.
                <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <i>"When the rich wage war, it's the poor who die."</i>, this phrase is by
                Jean-Paul Sartre, French philosopher, playwright
                and writer, and was published in a newspaper shortly after the end of the Second World War, and
                expresses much well the difference between waging a war and fighting a war. The powerful want to fight,
                but they never have the courage to
                face each other, after all... War kills, doesn 't it? So, they force the weakest to fight for an ideal
                that is not even theirs, and often they are just amused by the results. <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Of
                course, there are exceptions,
                WWII itself had a madman aiming to forcibly override his own opinion, and that had to be stopped. Even
                so, not everyone who fought for it, was in agreement with the ideas they were fighting to defend, if you
                depend on a voluntary military
                power, your army is formed only by those who have a huge will to fight, and of course will be great
                soldiers, but they are few. An exorbitant amount of people, free to die on the front lines as objects
                controlled by a general is clearly
                more efficient, after all, if they die, who cares?<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp During war, the value of
                a human life changes. It changes for nothing, because no one really cares about a soldier who died
                defending his country, other than
                all the people that person mattered to in life right? But we ignore that, after all, the feelings of
                these people don't matter, right?
                <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDuring war, the value of a human life changes. And now, the human being has
                no more value. If you 're a soldier and you die, you're just one more. One more for the statistics. You
                might even get a merit badge
                if you do something that will be remembered after the war, but what good is it? You are no longer a
                human, you are just a statistic.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp During war, the value of a human life
                changes. But... What is the value of
                a human life?
